Hi,

I am a 31 years old software engineer currently looking for a position. I live in Compiegne, France. 
I spent the last 10 years improving my skills, learning new things and working on awesome projects. 
I am a former Smalltalker, now having fun with functional languages (especially Clojure/ClojureScript).

My current position is about leading the front effort to unify all our apps, in term of codebase as well as UI.

I have always been a remote developer in an international team. So I have years of experience 
in asynchronous communication, self organisation, writing down documentation to not block the next guy, etc.

I also consider (big enough) FLOSS projects to be a good experience of remote work.

From my beginnings as a software making enthusiast I have been deeply involved in open source communities. 
I have been a core maintainer of Pharo, the most used FLOSS Smalltalk implementation. 
I have contributed to dozen of open source projects, and I am currently the lead maintainer of numbro, a js library for 
number formatting.

You can read more about myself (including my research papers, my presentations, and some blog articles) on my 
personal website: https://benjamin.vanryseghem.com.

Thank you for your time, I hope hearing from you soon, 
Benjamin Van Ryseghem
